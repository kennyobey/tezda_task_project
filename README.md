) to fetch and display product data efficiently, ensuring that data retrieval and rendering were optimized for performance.

Navigation Management: Implemented seamless navigation between the product listing and detail screens, enhancing user experience and ensuring smooth transitions.

Product Detail Screen: Designed a visually appealing and user-friendly UI for the product detail screen, balancing aesthetics with functionality to provide an engaging user experience.

Performance Optimization: Ensured smooth scrolling and efficient image loading by optimizing performance, which contributed to a responsive and fluid app experience.

Secure Authentication: Incorporated secure authentication mechanisms to protect user data, aligning with best practices for safeguarding sensitive information.

Authentication State Management: Managed user authentication state effectively, handling session by ensuring users remain authenticated across sessions.

User-Specific Features: Integrated functionality for users to mark products as favorites, enhancing the personalized experience and usability of the app.

Profile Screen Design: Created an intuitive and visually appealing profile screen for users to manage their information, providing a straightforward interface for personal data management.

Responsiveness: Ensured the app is responsive across various UI sizes, providing a consistent and optimized experience on all devices.

Use of GetX
I chose to use GetX due to its robust feature set, including:

Easy Navigation: Simplified the management of routes and navigation transitions.
Bottom Dialogues: Facilitated the implementation of bottom dialogues for enhanced user interactions.
Get Storage: Streamlined data persistence and retrieval with Get Storage.
Challenges and Solutions
One of the primary challenges I faced was designing a visually appealing UI. This challenge was addressed through extensive online research and leveraging design best practices, resulting in an improved and attractive user interface.

Additional Features and Constraints
In addition to the core requirements, I implemented a search feature to enhance user experience by allowing users to find products more easily.
